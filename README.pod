=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Command::secret - Create application secrets() consisting of random bytes

=head1 MOJOLICIOUS VERSION

If your Mojolicious version is less than 4.63 then you must
L<use version 0.02|https://github.com/sshaw/Mojolicious-Command-secret/tree/v0.02>
of this module.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tired of manually creating and adding secrets? Me too! Use this command to create secrets
and automatically add them to your C<Mojolicous> or C<Mojolicious::Lite> application:

 ./script/your_app secret
 ./lite_app secret

B<This will modify the appropriate application file>, though existing secrets will not be overridden
unless the C<-f> option is used.

It is assumed that your file contains UTF-8 data and that you use C<$self> or C<app> to refer
to your application instance.

If you do not want to automatically add secrets to your application use the C<mojo secret> command or
the C<-p> option and the secrets will be printed to C<STDOUT> instead:

 mojo secret
 ./script/your_app secret -p
